## My Kernels
### 1. Income Prediction with K-nearest Neighbor algorithm, Neural Network, and Decision Tree
The R code and data file is in the 01_IncomePrediction folder. You can found the [kernel on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yipfafa/r-income-prediction-with-knn-nn-decision-tree).

In this kernel, I used R to demostrate the data cleaseing process and preparation for modeling tools: removing unnecessary variables, identify outliers, and reclassification of categorical variables. In addition, I created prediction models by using different modeling techniques: **Neural Networ**, **K-nearest Neighbor algorithm**, **CART algorithm**, and **C4.5 algorithm**. Also, I will demonstrate how to use the *misclassification costs* to adjust the models. Finally, I will conduct an evaluation of the modeling result from *cost-benefit analysis* approach.
