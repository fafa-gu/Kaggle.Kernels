In this kernel, I used R to demostrate the data cleaseing process and preparation for modeling tools: removing unnecessary variables, identify outliers, and reclassification of categorical variables. In addition, I created prediction models by using different modeling techniques: <span style="background-color: #453781; color: white;">**Neural Networ**</span>, <span style="background-color: #1F968B; color: white;">**K-nearest Neighbor algorithm**</span>, <span style="background-color: #55C667; color: white;">**CART algorithm**</span>, and <span style="background-color: #B8DE29; color: white;">**C4.5 algorithm**</span>. Also, I will demonstrate how to use the <span style="color:#287D8E">**misclassification costs**</span> to adjust the models. Finally, I will conduct an evaluation of the modeling result from <span style="color:#2D708E">**cost-benefit analysis**</span> approach.
