# Income Prediction with KNN+ NN+ Decision Tree
This repository stores the script, the data, and its description for the Kaggle Kernels. In the kernel, I used R to demostrate the data cleaseing process and preparation for modeling tools: removing unnecessary variables, identify outliers, and reclassification of categorical variables. In addition, I created prediction models by using different modeling techniques: Neural Network, K-nearest Neighbor algorithm, CART algorithm, and C4.5 algorithm. Also, I demonstrated how to use the misclassification costs to adjust the models. Finally, I conducted an evaluation of the modeling result from cost-benefit analysis approach.
